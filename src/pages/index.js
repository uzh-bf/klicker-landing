                  Based on the newly introduced question pool, lecturers can
                  manage all their past as well as future questions in one
                  place. The advanced question management allows lecturers to
                  create and arrange questions into sessions prior to their
                  lectures, allowing them to plan their lectures in advance.
                </FeatureOverview.Item>
                <FeatureOverview.Item title="Dedicated Presentation Mode">
                  With the dedicated presentation mode, lecturers always have
                  the most important information available at a glance. The
                  session evaluation screen can be displayed independently from
                  the remainder of the application and is purely focused on
                  presenting the results of an evaluation as cleanly as
                  possible.
                </FeatureOverview.Item>
                <FeatureOverview.Item title="Advanced Question Types">
                  KlickerUZH offers a range of different question types such as
                  single choice (SC), multiple choice (MC), free text (FT), and
                  number ranges (NR). As an additional feature, solutions can be
                  defined and displayed for SC and MC questions. Further
                  question types are still on the roadmap.
                </FeatureOverview.Item>
                <FeatureOverview.Item title="Integrated Feedback-Channel">
                  The integrated feedback channel and confusion barometer allow
                  lecturers to receive instant feedback on the difficulty and
                  speed of their lecture and enable them to react to any
                  occurring questions and problems on the fly.

                <FeatureOverview.Item title="Multi-Language Support">
                  KlickerUZH is already available in German and English. It was
                  made to be easily extendable to further languages.

                  The development and sources of KlickerUZH are completely open
                  source. This gives lecturers the potential to implement their
                  own visualizations, languages, or even question types.
                  Contributions and feedbacks are always welcome!
